1. Inspired from the [article](https://www.sigarch.org/increasing-your-research-impact/) by Mark Hill and then stumbling upon a recent [article](https://medium.com/@nidhibits224/multi-query-attention-speeding-ai-ad8fa1626b82) from my mentor during my first internship at TI, I realized how important it is to form hypothesis while doing research and prove it by doing back of the enevelope calculations. Lately, I have seen many people dissing the idea of doing excel-analysis. I still agree that it should not be the only analysis while publishing a paper. However, I realized it is still the foundation of doing research.

2. "The purpose of (scientific) computing is insight, not numbers" -- Richard Hamming. This quote reminded me one of his famous talks on [You and Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).
