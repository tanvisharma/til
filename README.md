Today I learnt or re-learnt.

The world is flooding with information these days and as a PhD student (and a person who likes learning new things), it gets difficult for me to remember everything I come across on a daily basis. Sometimes, it gets overwhelming to process everything and derails me from my thesis project. Some days it helps me get a new idea about my research. Nonetheless, I believe it is important to stay updated with the research trends and the world in general. I am creating this repository to capture all the new concepts I learn or re-learn (sometimes you know about it but it has slipped from your brain) on a daily basis. Of course, there will be many things I might learn and they could be related to life, sports, cooking, art, politics, books, relatable quotes, work philosophy or anything else. This repository, however, is solely dedicated to learnings related to computer research.

Cheers and keep learning!
